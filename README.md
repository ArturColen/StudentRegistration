# Student registration form
The project developed was the last work of the year in the Logic and Programming course at [Col√©gio Cotemig](https://www.cotemig.com.br/), consisting of a form created through the .NET Framework and linked to an SQL database.

* After running the database you created earlier (by clicking ‚ö°), click `Server` at the top of MySQL Workbench
* Then click `Data Export` and select the school database in the `Tables to Export` area
* Make sure `Dump Structure and Data` is selected and check where you want to export the database (in this case, inside the folder of the project that was cloned)
* Scroll down and click the `Start Export` button
* If a warning appears on your screen, click on `Overwrite` and then `OK` (leave the password space empty)

### 6. Run the project
